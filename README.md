A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

## First Exam

In this exam, an "open" shape appears for several milliseconds (right side shape or left side shape).

As soon as the time period has expired, the form is replaced with a "complete" form.

The user will have to choose which the direction of the shape he saw.

The user will be presented with the choice again, but the amount of time he is exposed to it will decrease if he made the correct choice.

## Second Exam: Double game
---

In this exam, the user is presented with two cards, each of which has only one common symbol. The user needs to identify the common symbol and press on it as quickly as possible.
